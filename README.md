Car Price Prediction

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning model designed to predict the prices of cars based on various features. Leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques, this project aims to provide accurate and insightful price estimations.

Project Overview
Car pricing is a complex process influenced by numerous factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more. This project addresses this challenge by building a predictive model that can estimate car prices based on these attributes.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for optimal performance.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Building: Implementing a custom multiple linear regression model.
Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Visualizing data and model predictions for better understanding.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web app.
